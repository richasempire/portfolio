			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations </h2>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Seeks to spotlight age distribution variances in the population, providing a macroscopic view of demographic shifts.</li>
				<li>The design struggles to clearly depict changes in age and gender demographics over time, making it hard to discern detailed patterns.</li>
				<li>The chart's layout, with males above and females below the bar, might cause confusion. A clearer design could better communicate the data. As this is just the first attempt, let's look forward to the next one.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A streamlined line chart addresses the previous concerns, offering a distinct portrayal of population and gender dynamics in a change of century.
				</li>
				<li>My interest lay in the evolution of life expectancy reading the previous chart. This chart not only sheds light on this but also reveals a striking increase in life expectancy in women.</li>
				<li>The century's rise in life expectancy, especially for women, intrigued me. Women's empowerment and the baby boomers' era played roles, but the stark gender disparity in longevity became apparent when factoring in the world wars' impact on men. Our next step is to precisely quantify this difference.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This visualization stands out as my favorite, concisely showcasing the gender demographics and the century's population evolution.</li>
				<li>The depiction strikes the right balance, employing integral dimensions and filtering out interferences and redundancies for clearer insights.</li>
				<li>Perception is simplified and enhanced with creativity.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Navigating through these visualizations has been an insightful journey. The standout was third sketch, which struck the perfect balance between simplicity and detail, offering a clear snapshot of a century's worth of gender demographics and population shifts.
      </p>

	  <p> First sketch laid the groundwork with its classic bar chart, yet it stumbled slightly with overlapping bars. Sketch two stepped it up with a line graph that traced population trends more neatly, though it left some finer details in the shadows.</p>
	  <p> In the end, third sketch clinched it by delivering a precise, uncluttered comparison of gender demographics over a hundred years. This exercise underscored the transformative power of thoughtful design in data visualization, turning numbers into narratives and abstracts into insights. Moving forward, I'm armed with the lessons of simplicity, clarity, and creativity in visual storytelling.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Leveraging the insights from the sketching exercise, I brought Tableau into play, utilizing its advanced tools like trend lines and average population metrics for deeper analysis. I opted for a butterfly chart, a strategic choice for comparative visualization, to facilitate direct comparison, aligning with my goal of contrasting male and female life expectancy. By adjusting the opacity of the bar chart and incorporating green extensions to represent a higher female population, I steered clear of stereotypical color coding, promoting an unbiased interpretation of the data. My aim wasn't to craft a narrative but to present a platform for independent conclusions, ensuring my visualization aids in objective analysis through effective data encoding and visual hierarchy.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
       1. Journey from Sketching to Advanced Tableau: Transitioned from initial sketches to mastering advanced Tableau techniques, enhancing the depth of the analysis.
      </p>
	  <p>
		2. Butterfly Chart for Gender Comparison: Chose a butterfly chart to compare male and female life expectancies, avoiding stereotypical color conventions for an unbiased view.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		3. Incorporating Advanced Metrics: Utilized trend lines and average population metrics in Tableau to reveal nuanced differences in life expectancy.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		4. Symbolic Representation: Used green extensions to symbolize a higher female population, adding a subtle yet impactful dimension to the analysis.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		5. Clarity from Sketching: Gained clarity from sketching three times, which enabled the investment of time in learning advanced Tableau skills.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		6. Art of Visualization: Recognized that the power of visualization lies in its ability to provoke thought and invite interpretation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		7. Refined Approach to Visual Storytelling: Moving forward with a refined approach that emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and an open narrative, bolstered by advanced technical capabilities.
